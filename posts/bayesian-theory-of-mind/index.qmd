Bayesian Theory of Mind models how agents infer others' hidden mental states from observable actions.

## Bayes' Rule

We update a hypothesis $H$ about an agent's intention after seeing data $D$ via Bayes' rule:

$$
P(H \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H) P(H)}{P(D)}.
$$

For example, suppose a robot infers whether a person wants tea ($H$) after watching them fill a kettle ($D$). With prior belief $P(H)=0.3$, likelihood $P(D\mid H)=0.8$, and marginal $P(D)=0.41$, the posterior is computed below.

```python
prior = 0.3
likelihood = 0.8
evidence = 0.41
posterior = likelihood * prior / evidence
posterior
```

## Sequential Updates

Bayesian agents can repeatedly incorporate new evidence. The snippet below simulates three observations and prints the updated belief after each.

```python
import numpy as np

prior = 0.5
data = [0.9, 0.7, 0.2]
for likelihood in data:
    prior = likelihood * prior / (likelihood * prior + (1 - likelihood) * (1 - prior))
    print(prior)
```

These simple calculations demonstrate how Bayesian reasoning can support a theory of mind in artificial agents.
